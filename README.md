Purpose:

This is a simple memory game implemented in Python. The game requires two players to take turns and match pairs of numbers and letters. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.

- The game consists of a sequence of numbers from 1 to 20, along with a corresponding set of letters.
- The numbers and letters are randomly shuffled.
- Each player takes turns to select two numbers from the sequence.
- The corresponding letters of the selected numbers are revealed.
- If the letters match, the player earns a point, and the matched numbers are replaced with an asterisk (*).
- If the letters do not match, no points are awarded.
- The game continues until all 20 numbers have been matched.
- At the end of the game, the player with the highest score is declared the winner.
